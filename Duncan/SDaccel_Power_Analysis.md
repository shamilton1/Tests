# Analyzing Power With SDAccel

The SDAccel Environment has a feature to estimate the power used by the FPGA. Power analysis is **not** enabled by default in the AWS F1 instance, however it may be enabled with a command line option. 

## Enabling Power Analysis

Power analysis can only be performed in the System/Hardware flow: it is not performed during SW Emulation or HW emulation. It may be enabled by the following command line switch to your existing **xocc** command line. 

```
	$ xocc YOUR_EXISTING_COMMAND_LINE --xp vivado_param:project.runs.noReportGeneration=0
```
This option enables the generation of all implementation reports. Many of these reports contain detailed information about the hardware implementation. In general, these reports are only recommended for users with experience in RTL hardware design, and hence they are not generated by default.

With the option above ambled, the power reports can be reviewed at the following locations (referenced from inside your SDAccel project directory), where **<KERNEL>** is the name of your kernel. 

./System/_xocc_link_<KERNEL>/impl/build/system/<KERNEL>/bitstream/<KERNEL>_ipi/ipiimpl/ipiimpl.runs/impl_1/xcl_design_wrapper_power_summary_routed.pb
./System/_xocc_link_<KERNEL>/impl/build/system/<KERNEL>/bitstream/<KERNEL>_ipi/ipiimpl/ipiimpl.runs/impl_1/xcl_design_wrapper_power_routed.rpt
./System/_xocc_link_<KERNEL>/impl/build/system/<KERNEL>/bitstream/<KERNEL>_ipi/ipiimpl/ipiimpl.runs/impl_1/xcl_design_wrapper_power_routed.rpx
