# Getting Started on AWS F1 with SDAccel and RTL Kernels

This getting started guide is intended for hardware designers looking to create AWS F1 applications leveraging new or existing RTL code.

## 1. Setup and testing your environment
This step will show you how to:
- Start and AWS F1 instance
- Load the SDAccel environment on AWS F1
You will need the following
- A Xilinx account - create one here
- A Github account - create one here
An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account - create one here

[DETAILS](1. Setup and test your environment.md)

## 2. Run your first SDAccel program on AWS F1
This step will show you how to:
- Download SDAccel examples from Github
- Package an existing RTL design as an SDAccel acceleration kernel
- Compile, execute and profile a simple example accelerated with the RTL kernel

[DETAILS](2. Run your first SDAccel program on AWS F1.md)

## 3. Develop your SDAccel knowledge 
This step will take you through an introductory online training course covering:
- Introduction to AWS F1 and the SDAccel Development Environment
- AWS F1 hardware specifications and requirements
- Packaging existing RTL IP for AWS F1
- Running a host-side application with an RTL kernel

[DETAILS](4. Practice and Experiment.md)

## 4. Practice and Experiment
This step will show you how to:
- Run additional labs and examples on F1
- Learn more about SDAccel
- Get support and troubleshoot issues

[DETAILS](5. Install and run SDAccel on your own machine.md)

## 5. Install and run SDAccel on your own machine
The AWS F1 instances loaded with the FPGA developer AMI provide all the necessary tools to develop, compile, execute and debug your application in the Amazon cloud. Optionally, it is also possible to develop and compile your application on your own machine and upload it to AWS for execution and debug in the cloud.
This optional step will show you how to:
- Install and license SDAccel locally on your machine
- Compile a simple example locally
- Upload and execute it on AWS F1
You will need the following:
- A Linux computer running either:
  - Red Hat Enterprise Workstation/Server 7.2 and 7.3 (64-bit)
  - Red Hat Enterprise Workstation 6.7 and 6.8 (64-bit)
  - CentOS 6.8, CentOS 7.3 (64-bit)
  - Ubuntu Linux 16.04.1 LTS (64-bit)
