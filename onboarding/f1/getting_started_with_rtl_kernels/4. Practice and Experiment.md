# 4. Practice and Experiment

Apply and practice what you've learned in the earlier steps of this guide by running more hands-on examples, familiarize yourself with the online SDAccel document and make your way to the AWS forum to search knowledge and find answers.

## Experiment with other examples

Running and experimenting with these three examples of the RTL kernels will help you further familiarize yourself with the RTL kernel flow

#### Vector Addition with 2 clocks
This example shows vector addition performed by an RTL kernel with 2 clocks and the use of the ```--kernel_frequency``` XOCC option.

[Download and run this example](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/925491d13b179f5ea305cd66cab1a4b8c3d36c5c/getting_started/rtl_kernel/rtl_vadd_2clks) from the SDAccel Github repository

#### Vector Addition with 2 kernels
This example shows how create an accelerated design using more than one RTL Kernel. In this example Vector Addition is performed with 2 kernels. Both Kernel_0 and Kernel_1 perform vector addition. The Kernel_1 reads the output from Kernel_0 as one of two inputs.

#### High Performance Matrix Multiply with precompiled XO file and advanced Vivado implementation options
This example implements a high performance matrix multiplication of two input matrices (A*B=C). The matrix multiplication kernel operates on matrices of type int16 and produces int16 results. Internally, the kernel has a systolic array of 2048 DSP units and is attached to two DDR banks. The DSP array runs at 400 MHz whereas the logic around the array runs at 300 MHz.
